        <p>
            My name is Jordan Sickmiller. I like to go camping with my friends, we usually will fish, swim, and have campfires. I also like to play backyard sports with my neighboors such as 2 on 2 football or baseball. My favorite games to play are GTA RP and The Last of Us. <br> I also like to build and upgrade PCs when I can. My neighboors and I also like making our own sports with my favorite being a mix betwen soccer and football. The game is just soccer but using a big yoga ball and you are allowed to tackle the other team.

        <p>
            I was born in <strong>Wauseon, Ohio</strong> and have lived there ever since. I live less then five minutes away from the Fulton County Fair. I live with my mom, dad and sister. I have two dogs and a cat. I work at the Wauseon Marathon right next to Auto Zone. <br> I've worked there for about three years and have been a manager for about two. I started right after I turned 14 and have been working ever since. I usually get about 20 hours a week.

            <em>Why I Joined this Class</em>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            I've always have been interested about how to code websites and video games. My goal in life is to make a video game that is enjoyable. I'd also like to work for some type of game company with my goal being Treyarch. <br> I have already taken a class in Wauseon called Web Design where we made multiple websites. I've tried making a game using Unreal Engine 5 but I didn't know how to actually create models. I ended up just having a world and some buildings but nothing to do but walk around. By the end of Four County I hope to be able to make a working game.

        <em>Sports</em>
        </h3>

        <p>
            The first sport I've ever played was baseball. I started baseball when I was 5 and played all the way up to 2020. Nobody wanted to play in 2020 because we were going to have to wear masks while playing and nobody signed up. I then played played in 7th and 8th grade for my final years and then didn't sign up for highschool baseball. I also played basketball in 8th grade but didn't like it.
